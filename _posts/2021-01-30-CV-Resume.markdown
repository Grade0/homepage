<h2 style="font-size: 28px; color:#5B9BD5;"><u>Programming Skills</u></h2>
<p></p>

#### C

Good knowledge of C and programming language. I studied C during my bachelor degree, where I had the opportunity to practice a lot on the assignments of Programming 1, Algorithms and data structures, Unix Programming classes (covering topics like Trees, Graph, Locks, Condition Variables, Thread, Socket,...)

#### Java

I studied Java during my Bachelor degree and during the years I improved my knowledge developing some projects.
I used Java to implement a multi thread server and many assignments (covering topics like OOP, Inheritance, Dynamic Dispatch, Exceptions, Java Collection Framework, Generics, Monitor, Selector, NIO, Thread-pool, RMI, TCP, UDP, ...)

#### HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP

I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScipt and a little bit of PHP when I attended the "Web Design" Class, during my Erasmus exchange in University College Dublin. 
I developed a fully working webpage as final project. 

#### ORACLE PL/SQL and Database

During my bachelor degree I attended two database classes, the first one was a theoretical course and the second was a practical course where we applied all the techniques learned from the previous one. As final project me and my team have built a full-stack web-application for an hypothetical e-commerce for brewers. I learned a lot from that project because I enhance some soft-skill like <b><u>team-working</u></b>, <b><u>Communication</u></b> and <b><u>Agile software development</u></b>, 

#### Python

Although I had some experience in Python programming during my Bachelor degree I learned this language mostly by self taught and practicing it by developing an easy command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game.

#### OCaML

I learned OCaML as part of the "Programming 2" class' program about <b><u>functional programming</u></b>. With OCaML I learned how this paradigm is closely connected to the <b><u>recursion</u></b> and the use of concepts such as <b><u>partial evaluation of functions</u></b>. As project I designed and developed an <b><u>basic interpreter</u></b> in Ocaml that allows you to manipulate dictionaries in addition to primitive data types.

#### Assembler D-RISC

Basic knowledge of this language such as logical arithmetic instructions, memory istructions, conditional and unconditional jump instructions, ect learned from "Computer architecture" class for the allocation / management of resources.
