I am an IBC (Italian Born Chinese) guy born in Rome and raised in Naples, where I graduated in Accounting from High School before moving to Pisa for the university. I define myself as an entreprising person with a strong desire to see the world, face the unknown and perpetually curious, as well as sociable person who is always ready to get involed.
