<h2 style="color:#5B9BD5;">Programming skills</h2>
<p></p>

#### C

Good knowledge of C and programming language. I studied C during my bachelor's degree, where I had the opportunity to practice a lot on the assignments of Programming 1, Algorithms and data structures, Unix Programming classes (covering topics like Trees, Graph, Locks, Condition Variables, Thread, Socket,...)

#### Java

I studied Java during my bachelor's degree and during the years I improved my knowledge developing some projects.
I used Java to implement a multi-thread server and many assignments (covering topics like OOP, Inheritance, Dynamic Dispatch, Exceptions, Java Collection Framework, Generics, Monitor, Selector, NIO, Thread-pool, RMI, TCP, UDP, ...)

#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScipt and a little bit of PHP when I attended the "Web Design" Class, during my Erasmus+ exchange at University College Dublin. 
I developed a fully working webpage as the final project. 

#### ORACLE PL/SQL and Database

During my bachelor's degree I attended two database classes, the first one was a theoretical course and the second was a practical course where we applied all the techniques learned from the previous one. As the final project my team and I have built a full-stack web-application for an hypothetical "e-commerce" for brewers. I learned a lot from that project because I enhance some soft-skill like <b>team-working</b>, <b>communication</b> and <b>Agile software development</b>, 

#### Python

Although I had some experience in Python programming during my bachelor's degree I learned this language mostly by self-taught and practicing it by developing an easy command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game.

#### OCaML

I learned OCaML as part of the "Programming 2" class' program about <b>functional programming</b>. With OCaML I learned how this paradigm is closely connected to the <b>recursion</b> and the use of concepts such as <b>partial evaluation of functions</b>. As project I designed and developed an <b>basic interpreter</b> in Ocaml that allows you to manipulate dictionaries in addition to primitive data types.

#### Assembler D-RISC

Basic knowledge of this language such as logical arithmetic instructions, memory instructions, conditional and unconditional jump instructions, etc learned from the "Computer architecture" class for the allocation/management of resources.
